NEVER assume it's because you're mistaken, or you're somehow not smart enough.  Just set your cursor to that place, and type \"JM: I don't understand this,\" or whatever comment you have.  Asking pointed questions will help me fix it even quicker, i.e., \"I know you want to teach A here, but how does B relate to that?  And why does C follow B?  I think you left out the connection between D and E...\" or some-such.\n",

I'm interested in whether you chose to march carefully through it with your first read, or you breezed through it twice first and THEN slowed down to master each concept linearly.  Very interested in how you approach it, please write that down.\n",

It all starts here.  Today we will build a NN that can learn by trial-and-error: make a prediction, learn from its mistakes, and do better next time.  Our NN will solve a simple binary classifaction problem, i.e., \"given these 1's and 0's in the matrix X as inputs, what is your prediction that the 1's and 0's in matrix y will be?\"\n",

This chivalrous knight tells you the distance you are from Castle y (this is the l2_error, or \"how much you missed the princess by\"). Before you disappear (remember: POOF!) and end up back in your house tomorrow morning, you want to compute  how you want to change today's failed l2 prediction such that tomorrow your l2 prediction will be perfect and you can fall into your beloved's arms.

These are the derivatives of l2.  Think of these derivatives as the set of turns in today's directions.  Some of those turns you were super-confident of.  With other turns, you weren't certain if they were right or not.  \n",

But your trip seems to be taking longer than you expected, and you wonder, \"Gee, did I miss a turn?\"  Less confident.  Then, as time passes and you should have arrived by now, you become more certain you missed that turn.  Low confidence.  And you know you are not at your destination, but you are not sure where your destination is from your current location.  So now, you stop and ask a nice lady for directions, but she tells you more turns and landmarks than you can remember, so you can only follow her directions part-way before you are again unsure how to proceed.

At first, you were sure you were on the correct route. Then, you wondered if you missed a turn. Then you were certain you missed a turn, and stopped to ask directions before proceeding further.\n",
        "\n",
        "That's a similar process to what a NN goes through.  So let's return now to your life as a romantic, driving neural network:  \n",
        "\n",
        "Every day, on every trip, you (our 3-layer network) start out with a set of directions to the princess (syn0).  When those directions end, you stop at l1 and ask for fresh directions (syn1).  These take you to your final destination of the day, your prediction of where you *thought* the princess was.  But no castle stands before you.  So you ask the knight, \"How far to the castle? (l2_error)\" And because you are a calculus genius, you can multiply the l2_error by how confident you were in each turn of your directions (the derivative, or slope, of l2) and come up with where you want to arrive tomorrow (your l2_delta).  \n",
        "\n",
        "Continuing your (unmistakeable) genius, now you can work backwards (back propagation).  You will multiply tomorrow's ideal arrival (l2_delta) by today's not-so-perfect directions (syn1) to figure out the first place you went wrong on today's route (l1_error, which is the distance between today's screwy l1 stop and tomorrow's fabulous l1 stop where asking for directions will yield greater joy).  \n",
        "\n",
        "You can then multiply the l1_error by how confident you were in your *first* set of directions that got you to l1, and the product will be the l1_delta, with which you can eagerly update syn0 to bring you ever-closer to your betrothed.  I am brushing back the tears, just thinking about it...\n",
        "\n",
        "So you must compute 3 facts before you can learn from them and re-attempt your quest for the princess's castle.  You must know:\n",
        "1) Your current location (l2);\n",
        "2) How far you are from the gas station (l2_error); and\n",
        "3) What changes you need to make in your set of turns to increase your certainty that your next driving attempt will get you closer to the station (l2_delta).\n",
        "\n",
        "Once you possess these three facts, then you can compute the required changes in the navigation turns (i.e., the weights of the synapses).   This is line 75, the change to the weights of syn1, which is the product of l1 and l2_delta.  The changes in syn1 will help to realize the changes you seek in your next l2 (i.e., to end up closer to that darn castle).\n",
        "\n",
        "So, how do we compute the l2_delta?  Here is where you will see the beauty of the Sigmoid function in four *magical* steps.  To me, the genius of our neural network's ability to learn is found largely in these four steps.  We saw how, in line 39, Step 1 was when the `nonlin()` transformed each value of our matrix into a statistical probability (i.e., a prediction) between 0 and 1.  But I have yet to mention that that statistical probability is ***also*** a simple measure of confidence--numbers approaching 1 suggest high confidence that the NN's (neural network's) prediction of \"1\" is correct.  Numbers approaching 0 suggest high confidence that the NN's prediction of \"0\" is correct.  This is ***Big Advantage #2*** of the ***Four Big Advantages of the Sigmoid Function:***  If our NN's prediction, the four values of l2, is high-confidence and high-accuracy, that's an oustanding prediction, and we want to leave the syn0 and syn1 weights that produced that oustanding prediction alone.  We don't want to mess with what's working; we want to fix what's NOT working.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let me explain the above from a different angle: right now, our NN is dealing with a pretty abstract problem, i.e., 1's and 0's.  Let's give those 1's and 0's meaning: imagine that our problem is one of image recognition, e.g., \"Is there a fish in this image?  \"1\" means, Yes, and \"0\" means No. Within this context, the output is simultaneously a prediction and a confidence measure.  An output of 0.999 is the equivalent of the network saying \"I am extremely confident that there is a fish in this picture\".  A number of 0.001 is the equivalent of \"There is definitely not a fish in this picture\".  Low confidence numbers are in the vicinity of 0.5.  For example, a value of 0.4 would be similar to \"I don't think there is a fish in this picture, but I'm not sure.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "That's why we focus our attention on the numbers in the middle:  all numbers approaching 0.5 in the middle are wishy-washy, and lacking confidence.  So, how can we tweak our NN to produce four l2 values that are both high-confidence and high-accuracy?  \n",
        "\n",
        "The key lies in the values, or ***weights*** of syn0 and syn1.  As I mentioned above, syn0 and syn1 are the center, the absolute *brains* or our neural network.  We are going to take the four values of the l2_error and perform beautiful, elegant math on them to produce an l2_delta.  l2_delta means, basically, \"the change we want to see in the output of the network (l2) so that it better resembles y (the truth).\"  In other words, l2_delta is the change you want to see in l2 in the next feed-forward pass in the next iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "***Get ready for beauty.***\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is ***Big Advantage #3*** of the ***Four Big Advantages of the Sigmoid Function:*** Do you remember that diagram of the beautiful S-curve of the Sigmoid function that I showed you above?  Well, lo-and-behold, each of the 4 probability/confidence values of l2 lies somewhere on the S curve of the sigmoid graph (pictured again below, but this time with more detail).  If we search for that number (e.g. 0.9) on the Y axis of the graph below, we can see that it corresponds with a point on the S curve roughly where you see the green dot: ![alt text](https://iamtrask.github.io/img/sigmoid-deriv-2.png)\n",

        "Did you notice not only the green dot but also the green line through the dot?  That green line is meant to represent the slope of the *tangent* to the line at the exact point where that dot is.  You don't need to know calculus to take the slope of a curve at a particular point--the computer will do that for you.  But you do have to notice that the S curve above has very shallow slope at both the upper extreme (near 1) and the lower extreme (near 0).  Does that sound familiar?  Wonder of wonders, a shallow slope on the sigmoid curve coincides with high confidence and high accuracy in our predictions!  And you also need to know that a shallow slope on the S-curve comes out to a tiny number for slope.  That's good news.  Why?\n",
        "\n",
        "Because, when we go to update our synapses, we basically want to leave our high confidence weights alone since they already have good accuracy.  To \"leave them alone\" means to multiply them by tiny numbers, near zero, so the values remain virtually unchanged.  And here comes ***Big Advantage #4*** of the ***Four Big Advantages of the Sigmoid Function:*** Miracle-of-miracles, our high-confidence numbers correspond to shallow slope on the S-curve, which corresponds to tiny slope numbers.  Therefore, multiplying the values of syn0 and syn1 by these teeny-tiny numbers has exactly the effect we want: the values in our synapses are left virtually unchanged, so our confident, accurate, high-performing values in l2 remain so.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the same token, our wishy-washy, indecisive, low-accuracy l2 values, which correspond to points in the middle of the S-curve, are the numbers that have the biggest slope on our S-curve.  What I mean is, the values around 0.5 can be traced on the Y axis of our graph below to the middle of the S-curve, where the slope is steepest, and therefore the value of that slope is a big number.  Those big numbers mean a big change when we multiply them by the wishy-washy values in l2, as we do in line 61.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Super Key Point: Positive-or-Negative Direction, and Gradient Descent\n",
        "When we update our synapse matrix by multiplying its corresponding element (aka, its value or number) with that large slope number, it's going to give that element a big nudge in the right direction towards confident and accurate prediction.  When I say, \"in the right direction,\" what I mean is that some values of our l2_delta are going to be negative values, because we want the product of these negative values, when multiplied by the weight values of our synapse matrix, to approach 0.  Other values of our l2_delta are going to be positive, because we want them to increase the weight values and thereby nudge the elements in syn0 and syn1 to approach 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "So it's important to notice that there is a sense of \"direction\" involved here.  When we talk about \"what direction is the target y value from our current l2 value?\" we mean, do we need to multiply each weight in syn1 by a positive l2_delta value to move it in a positive, larger direction, or by a negative l2_delta value to move it in a negative direction?\n",

        "Have you heard of gradient descent?  Gradient descent is all about direction.  It is often described as, \"a ball dropped in a bowl and rolling in a **back-and-forth direction** until it comes to a rest at the global minimum, the bottom of the bowl.\"  That's what the Sigmoid does for us.  It helps us to find the bottom of the bowl, which minimizes the cost function, which minimizes the error in our predictions.  Think of our 60,000 iterations as the ball rolling in a back-and-forth direction in the bowl until it no longer needs to change direction because it has come to rest at the ideal, perfect bottom of that bowl, where error as at a minimum, and life is good.

Of the 3 \"bowls\" pictured in the diagram above, it is clear that the true global minimum is the deepest bowl on the far left.  But, for simplicity's sake, let's pretend that the bowl in the middle is the global minimum.  So, a steep slope downwards to the right (i.e., a negative slope value, as depicted by the green line in the picture) means our ball will roll a lot in the negative direction (i.e., to the right), causing a big, negative adjustment to the corresponding weights of syn1 that will be used in the next iteration to predict l2.  But if, for example, you have a shallow slope downwards to the left, that would mean the prediction value is already accurate and confident, which produces a tiny, positive slope value, so the ball will roll very little to the left (i.e., in a positive direction), thus adjusting by very little the corresponding weight in syn1, so the next iteration's prediction of that value will remain largely unchanged.  This makes sense because the back-and-forth motion of the rolling ball is becoming smaller and smaller before it soon comes to rest at the global minimum, the bottom of the bowl, so there's no need to move much.  It is already close to the ideal.\n",

Next, in Step 10 we computed l2_delta by multiplying l2_error times the \"confidence level\" derivative (which is used to aggressively change low-confidence predictions).  And soon in Step 13 we will update syn1 by multiplying l2_delta by l1.  This multiplication is needed so that larger changes are applied to weights that have more impact on l2.  However, we do not apply this update until after we are ready to update syn0, for the sake of consistency.  \n",
        "\n",
        "This is an important distinction.  We know our goal is to get to The Ideal l2 Prediction, which is close to or the same as our truth, y.  But we'd only be using half our horsepower to get there if we only update syn1.  We want to update both syn1 and syn0 in order to maximize our efficiency in creating The Ideal I2.  Finding the l1_delta is the key to updating syn0, and that's our next job now.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Steps 11 and 12, we are going to compute the l1_delta, but in a slightly different manner.  We are going to use back propagation.    \n",
        "\n",
        "Consider this: back when we were finding l2_error, life was easy.  We knew l2, and we knew \"The Ideal l2\" we are shooting for, which was simply y.  But with l1_error, things are different.  We don't know what \"The Ideal l1\" is.  There's no y to tell us that.  y only tells us The Ideal l2.  So, how are we going to figure out what The Ideal l1 is?  We must first figure out how much l1 would need to change to produce the desired effect on l2.  We're going to have to take what we *do* know and work backwards.\n",
        "\n",
        "We know syn1.  It is the current navigational turns, acceleration and braking we used to drive to where we are now (l2), which is not yet at the gas station.  We know l2_delta.  It is \"how much we missed the mark (gas station) by\" (l2) but it is also our level of confidence (l2,deriv) about what went wrong and what needs fixing.  \n",
        "\n",
        "So, if we multiply the current (mistaken) navigation we used (syn1) by the changes we'd like to see in the next l2 (where we end up next time) (i.e., l2_delta), we can discover the mistakes in l1 (the l1_error) that led us off the best route to arriving at the gas station y.  Think of this as the \"contribution weighted error.\"  In other words, \"how much did the mistakes in l1 (the l1_error) contribute to the mistakes in l2 that took us off the perfect route to the gas station y?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "If we multiply our mistakes in navigation (syn1) by our mistakes in l1 (which contains all the mistakes we made the *first* time we got lost), that would take us to l2, the location we ended up at the *second* time we got lost.  But we're working backwards now.  So, if we multiply the changes we need in our second set of directions to get us to the gas station on the next attempt (l2_delta) by the navigation mistakes we just made that got us to our current, lost location (syn1), that product will tell us our l1_error (how much our first set of directions took us off the ideal route to the gas station).  Again: l1_error tells us how much our first set of directions (the product of l0 * syn0) **contributed** to ending up lost at this second, lost location (l2).  \n",
        "\n",
        "This multiplication of the values of syn1 by the values of l2_delta creates an l1_error that has large values for those compnents of l1 that have the biggest impact on l2.  And that's very good news, because now we know which components of l1 matter the most to l2, and we can tweak the weights of syn1 accordingly in the next iteration.  Using our princess castle analogy, tweaking the key weights in syn1 will take us from the \"first place we ended up when we got lost,\" l1, to a better place this time, an l2 closer to the gas station.  We'll still end up lost a second time (l2), but we'll be closer to the gas station y because we improved our navigation slightly on *both* routes that got us lost, syn0 and syn1.  We got a *tad* less lost on both routes this time, and arrived closer to the gas station.  \n",

She tells you how where the gas station is relative to where you are now and you figure out how you ended up here based on the route you took (e.g. It went wrong when I took that first exit.).

However, all of these instructions were pre-determined when you had the Triptik printed.  Building on the analogy, back-propagation is when the lady tells you how far off you are and you go back through your instructions and figure out which ones contributed the most to your error.
