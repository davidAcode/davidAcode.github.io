        "The best way to master Deep Learning is to master the fundamentals, build a neural network (NN), and then memorize the code, because then you can apply these fundamentals to any NN you meet in future academic papers or work projects.  It all starts here.  Today we will build a NN that can learn by trial-and-error: make a prediction, learn from its mistakes, and do better next time.  Our NN will solve a simple binary classifaction problem, i.e., \"given these 1's and 0's in the matrix X as inputs, what is your prediction of the 1's and 0's in matrix y will be?\"\n",

        "Thanks to super-teachers Andrew Trask and Siraj Raval, today's material--a working neural network in about 15 lines of Python--is the foundation of what you need to progress towards an understanding of the cutting edge techniques being used in deep learning today.  My mentor Adam Koenig, a Stanford PhD in aerospace engineering, helped me learn this stuff, and now I'm going to stand on these teachers' shoulders and help you learn it too.\n",

        "\"nonlin()\" above is a type of standard logistic function known as a Sigmoid function.  Logistic functions are very commonly used in science, statistics, and probability.  This Sigmoid function is written in a more complicated way than necessary because it serves two functions:\n",

        "We will see below that this is very important, because this conversion to a 0-1 number gives us **FOUR** very **big advantages**.  I will discuss these four in detail below, but for now, just know that the sigmoid function converts every number in every matrix within its parentheses into a number between 0 and 1 that falls somewhere on the S-curve illustrated here:\n",

        "So, Part 1 of the Sigmoid function has converted each value in the matrix into a number between 0 and 1, i.e., a statistical probability, which is also known as a confidence measure.  In other words, the number answers the question, \"how confident are we that this number correctly predicts an outcome?\"  \n",

We saw how, in line 39, Step 1 was when the `nonlin()` transformed each value of our matrix into a statistical probability between 0 and 1.  But I have yet to mention that that statistical probability is ***also*** a simple measure of confidence--numbers approaching 1 suggest high confidence that the NN's (neural network's) prediction is correct.  Numbers approaching 0 suggest high confidence that the NN's prediction is incorrect.  But what matters here is ***confidence.***  If our NN's prediction, the four values of l2, is high-confidence and high-accuracy, that's an oustanding prediction, and we want to leave the syn0 and syn1 weights that produced that oustanding prediction alone.

We are going to take the four values of the l2_error and perform beautiful, elegant math on them to produce an l2_delta.  l2_delta means, basically, \"the amount by which we need to increase-or-decrease our weight values in syn0 and syn1 in order to reduce wishy-washyness and maximize the high-confidence, high-accuracy values of the prediction of our next iteration.\"\n",

Well, lo-and-behold, each of the 4 probability/confidence values of l2 lies somewhere on the S curve of the sigmoid graph (pictured again below, but this time with more detail).  If we search for that number (e.g. 0.9) on the Y axis of the graph below, we can see that it corresponds with a point on the S curve roughly where you see the green dot: ![alt text](https://iamtrask.github.io/img/sigmoid-deriv-2.png)\n",

        "Did you notice not only the green dot but also the green line through the dot?  That green line is meant to represent the slope of the *tangent* to the line at the exact point where that dot is.  You don't need to know calculus to take the slope of a curve at a particular point--the computer will do that for you.  But you do have to notice that the S curve above has very shallow slope at both the upper extreme (near 1) and the lower extreme (near 0).  Does that sound familiar?  Wonder of wonders, a shallow slope on the sigmoid curve coincides with high confidence and high accuracy in our predictions!  And you also need to know that a shallow slope on the S-curve comes out to a tiny number for slope.  That's good news.  Why?\n",
        "\n",
        "Because, when we go to update our synapses, we basically want to leave our high confidence weights alone since they already have good accuracy.  To \"leave them alone\" means to multiply them by tiny numbers, near zero, so the values remain virtually unchanged.  And, miracle-of-miracles, because our high-confidence numbers correspond to shallow slope on the S-curve, which corresponds to tiny slope numbers, therefore multiplying the values of syn0 and syn1 by these teeny-tiny numbers has exactly the effect we want: the values in our synapses are left virtually unchanged, so our confident, accurate, high-performing values in l2 remain so.\n",
        "\n",
        "The other good news is that our wishy-washy, indecisive, low-accuracy l2 values, those corresponding to points in the middle of the S-curve, are the numbers that have the biggest slope on our S-curve.  What I mean is, the values around 0.5 can be traced on the Y axis of our graph below to the middle of the S-curve, where the slope is steepest, and therefore the value of that slope is a big number.  Those big numbers mean a big change when we multiply them by the values in l2, as we do in line 61.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we update our synapse matrix by multiplying the corresponding element with that large slope number, it's going to give that element a big nudge in the right direction towards confident and accurate prediction.  When I say, \"in the right direction,\" what I mean is that some values of our l2_delta are going to be negative, because we want them to reduce the weight values closer to 0 in syn0 and syn1.  Other values of our l2_delta are going to be positive, because we want them to increase the weight values closer to 1 in syn0 and syn1.  \n",
        "\n",
        "So it's important to notice that there is a sense of \"direction\" involved here.  When we talk about \"what direction is the y value from our current l2 value?\" we mean, do we need to multiply each weight in syn1 by a positive l2_delta value to move it in a positive, larger direction, or by a negative l2_delta value to move it in a negative direction?\n",
        "\n",
        "Have you heard of gradient descent?  Gradient descent is all about direction.  It is often described as, \"a ball dropped in a bowl and rolling in a **back-and-forth direction** until it comes to a rest at the global minimum, the bottom of the bowl.\"  That's what the Sigmoid does for us.  It helps us to find the bottom of the bowl, which is the minimum of the cost function, which is the lowest error in our predictions.  Think of our 60,000 iterations as the ball rolling in a back-and-forth direction in the bowl until it no longer needs to change direction because it has come to rest at the ideal, perfect bottom of that bowl.

A steep slope downwards to the right (i.e., a negative slope value) means our ball will roll a lot in the negative direction (i.e., to the right), causing a big change in the corresponding weights of syn1 to be used in the next iteration to predict l2.  A shallow slope downwards, say, to the left means that that prediction value is already accurate and confident, which produces a tiny, positive slope value, so the ball will roll very little to the left (i.e., in a positive direction), thus changing by very little the corresponding weight in syn1, so the next iteration's prediction of that value will remain largely unchanged.

        "In Step 10 we used l2 and l2_error to compute by how much, and whether positively or negatively, we should tweak the weights of syn1--the l2_delta.\n",
        "Now, in Steps 11 and 12, we are going to compute the l1_delta, but in a slightly different manner.  We are going to use back propogation.  For now, think of it as \"working backwards.\"  Here we go: \n",
        "\n",
        "First, we find the l1 error.  l1 error is the difference between the ideal l1 that would provide the ideal l2 we want and the most recent computed l1.  To find l1_error, we have to multiply how much our latest prediction missed the target (l2_error) by our last guess at the optimal weights (syn1). We'll then use l1_error to update syn0 below.\n",

        "\n",
        "In line 64, we first multiply our \"old syn1,\" the weights used on this current iteration, by the l2_error.  This is indeed working backwards, because it was this version of syn1 that gave us our current l2 prediction, which produced our current l2_error.  So, to multiply the l2_error by the old syn1 allows us to compute by how much the old l1 of this iteration missed the ideal l1.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Why?  Consider: if the old l1 had been perfect, then multiplying this perfect l1 by the old syn1 would have produced a better l2, with less l2_error.  But the old l1 wasn't perfect, therefore the l2_error is bigger than it could have been, so multiplying it by the old syn1 gives us a clear picture of by how much the old, imperfect l1 missed its ideal l1--the l1_error.  In other words, we learn by how much each value in l1 contributed to each corresponding value in the l2_error.\n",
        "\n",
        "AK, Trask describes this back proppgation like this: \n",
        "l1_error = l2_delta.dot(syn1.T)\n",
        "The above line of code uses the \"confidence weighted error\" from l2 to establish an error for l1. To do this, it simply sends the error across the weights from l2 to l1. This gives what you could call a \"contribution weighted error\" because we learn how much each node value in l1 \"contributed\" to the error in l2. This step is called \"backpropagating\" and is the namesake of the algorithm. We then update syn0 using the same steps we did in the 2 layer implementation.\n",
        "AK, I don't understand what Trask means by, \"sends the error across the weights from l2 to l1.\"  Can you explain?\n",

We want to tweak this middle layer of our NN so it sends a better prediction to l2, making it easier for l2 to better predict target y.  In order to answer this question, we need to find the l1_delta, which tells us how much to adjust the weights to produce large changes in low confidence values and small changes in high confidence values.\n"
