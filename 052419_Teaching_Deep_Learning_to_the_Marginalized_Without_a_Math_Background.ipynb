        "##1.1) The Big Picture: An Example\n",
        "Congratulations!  You are the wealthy owner of a fabulous pet shop.  One month ago, you launched a new kitty litter product, cleverly named, \"Litter Rip!\"  A big part of your success comes from your savvy use of AI.  You have built a deep learning neural network to choose the right potential new customers to whom you will send your targeted advertisements.  You seek folks whose beloved felines would be pleased to, \"let 'er rip,\" so to speak, upon your new cat toilet.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your secret weapon is your dataset.  You have data from surveys of your pet shop customers in the past month since you started selling Litter Rip! in your store.  These customer surveys include their answers to four stunningly insightful questions:  \n",
        "1. Do you own a cat who poops?\n",
        "2. Do you drink imported beer?\n",
        "3. In the past month, have you visited our award-winning website, LitterRip!.com?\n",
        "4. In the past month, have you purchased Litter Rip! for your poopin' puss?\n",
        "\n",
        "The answers to these four questions are known as \"features,\" (characteristics) of your past customers.  First, you will train your network by inputting the data from millions of past, overjoyed customers and their responses to the first **three** of the above four questions/features.  Your neural network will train itself, based solely on your old customers' answers to these first three questions, until it becomes **awesome** at predicting which of your old customers probably did buy Litter Rip!  You will then use your past customers' answers to the **fourth** question as your Test Set, to see how accurately your network is predicting.  Each time your network uses the first three answers to predict whether a given customer bought Litter Rip!, you compare that prediction to their actual answer to Question Four.  For example, if your network predicts, \"Yep, I bet this customer bought Litter Rip!\" and that customer's answer to Question Four was indeed Yes, then you have a successful neural network.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process is trial-and-error:  the network will predict, then compare its predictions to the actual answers to Question Four, and learn from its mistakes over 60,000 iterations.  \n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to understand that a neural network always trains on one dataset in order to make predictions on another dataset.   Once your network is fabulous at predicting purchasers of Litter Rip! from the past customers' database, then you can turn it loose on your *new* database, a list of hot prospects.  From your local veterinarian (who is secretly in love with you, you charmer...) you have obtained a fresh batch of surveys of people who have answered the same first three questions, and your by-now-well-trained network will predict who best to send your targeted ad to.  Pure genius!  OMG, how do you *do* it?\n",
        "\n",
        "The best way to master deep learning is to build a neural network and then memorize the code, because that way you can apply these fundamentals to any network you meet in future academic papers or work projects.  It all starts here.  Today you will build your first neural network.  Total Rock Star.\n",

The input layer is on the left: the three circles represent neurons (aka nodes or features. \"features\" is the least confusing term; I'll mostly use that below.).  You may recall our first three questions above represent our three features.  So for now, think of that column of three questions as representing one customer's responses.  Imagine the top circle on the left contains the answer to the question, \"Do you own a cat who poops?\"  The middle circle of the three contains the answer to, \"Do you drink imported beer?\"  The bottom circle of the input layer is the feature, \"Have you visited our website, LitterRip!.com?\"  So, if Customer One responded, \"Yes/No/Yes\" to the questions, the top circle would contain a 1, the middle circle would contain a 0, and the bottom circle would contain a 1.\n",

(or not).\"  The predicted probability will be between 0 and 1.  For example, an output prediction of 0.00001 means, \"Definitely won't buy,\"  0.2 means \"Probably won't buy,\" 0.8 is \"Probably will buy,\" and 0.999 is, \"You're damn right they'll buy Litter Rip! with joy in their hearts!\" \n",
        "\n",
        "The stand-alone circle on the right-hand side, labeled \"y,\" contains The Actual Truth, which is each customer's response to the fourth survey question, \"Have you purchased Litter Rip! for your poopin' puss?\"  For the circle labeled \"y\" there are only two choices: \"0\" means No, they did not buy, and \"1\" means Yes, they bought.  Our neural network will output a prediction of probability, compare it to y to see how accurate it was, and learn from its mistakes in the next iteration.  Trial-and-error.  60,000 times.

        "In the diagram above, the first prediction our network makes about which customers bought kitty litter is represented by the point at the top of the dotted, white line on the surface of the warped, curvy red bowl.  That point is very important, so let's call it Point A.  Think of Point A as the first prediction the network makes.  This is the first feed forward.  \n",
        "\n",
        "What most AI courses and blogs forget to mention is that Point A has a location defined by two coordinates on the white grid underneath the curvy red bowl.  This curvy bowl is not drifting in space.  It is sitting on a white grid with an X and a Y axis. Think of that white grid as a tabletop, and our warped red bowl actually sits on the tabletop, but the bowl's only point of contact with the tabletop is the very bottom-most dip in the bowl--the point where the dotted white line ends--the global minimum.  (I know the bowl would be too lopsided to actually sit properly, but humor me--this is just a quick-and-dirty analogy).    \n",
        "\n",
        "Now, pretend Point A is a little, white ball.  It has 3 coordinates: the X and Y axes tell you location on the grid (tabletop), and the third, Z coordinate is the height from the grid to Point A as it sits on the inner surface of the warped, red bowl.  Here's  a super-key insight: the two orange arrows you see, representing the X and Y axes on the grid, are actually the synapses syn0 and syn1 that you will learn about below.  As I eyeball Point A, its coordinates on the white grid look to be approximately (3,3) to me, assuming the orange arrows are the X and Y axes.  So for now, let's say syn0 is 3 and syn1 is 3 (I'm oversimplifying here on purpose).\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's where it gets cool: remember Customer One's Yes/No/Yes responses to the first three questions?  The network takes that 1,0,1 of Customer One, multiplies it by the synapses of syn0 and syn1 (plus some other fancy jazz, which we'll get to later), and makes a prediction: let's say, 0.5.  That's our first feed forward.  In other words, the network is predicting there is a 50% probability that Customer One bought Litter Rip!  \n",
        "\n",
        "Technically, feed forward ends there.  The next step is when the network compares that prediction, 0.5, to The Actual Truth, y, which is 1.  Customer One did indeed buy Litter Rip! (a wise choice), but our first prediction of 0.5 wasn't so accurate.  A prediction of, say, 0.99 would have been *very* accurate.\n",
        "\n",
        "And now things get super-cool:  Do you see that yellow, vertical arrow?  If I were drawing this diagram, I would have put that yellow arrow right under Point A--namely, at about (3,3) as I eyeball the grid.  If the vertical, yellow arrow were located just underneath Point A, then it would represent the 3rd coordinate, the height from Point A to its two coordinates on the white grid, syn0 and syn1, or (3,3).  The yellow arrow's height would then equal the error of that first prediction--how much it missed The Actual Truth.  That is to say y, the fourth survey answer of Yes, or 1, minus the prediction of 0.5 equals a miss of 0.5.  That yellow arrow would have a \"length\" of 0.5!  Ain't that cool?  This diagram is important because it allows us to see how the network thinks in terms of simple, 3-D geometry.  You just witnessed your first feed forward, complete with the added bonus of our yellow arrow measuring l2_error--how much we missed the target of y (which in this case is 1 or Yes).  You're a rock star.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a perfect example of why the best teacher is someone who learned yesterday the material you are learning today.  I only discovered the insight that the red, gradient descent bowl was sitting on the darn grid of syn0 and syn1 after a year of studying gradient descent, because all the experts take this point so for-granted that they don't bother mentioning it.  Here is a BIG chance for you to learn from my mistakes, and gain a super-key insight that eluded me for over a year, even though it was right under my nose.  \n",

        "Our goal with our network is training: we train our neural network to reduce the error of our predictions until they match y, which contains the customers' responses to Survey Question #4.  In other words, we find the fastest way to reduce error, which means to make that yellow arrow shorter, which means we need the most direct path for the white ball to roll down the curvy surface of the red bowl.  We need to find the most efficient route for that ball to roll down from the original Point A to the bottom-most dip of the warped, red bowl--the point that sits on the tabletop.  That is Utopia, folks--the place where the yellow arrow, the error in our predictions, would equal zero in length (the global minimum), meaning our predictions have minimal error and therefore our network would be stunningly accurate.  And the fastest, most efficient path for the white ball to roll down the surface of the curvy red bowl is represented by that white dotted line which hugs the surface of the red bowl.  Once we have completed our training, then our network can accurately predict which of the hot prospects our veterinarian gives us are most likely to buy Litter Rip!  \n",
        "\n",
        "So, consider our scenario now: we started at the top of that white, dotted line, where Point A's height (the yellow arrow, the amount of error in our first prediction) equals 0.5.  How do we roll the ball down the bowl to get to the bottom, where the yellow arrow--the amount of error--is zero?  In other words, how do we tweak our original synapses of (3,3) so that their coordinates will move on the grid to the point *right* under the bowl's bottom, at (roughly) (3,0)?  So far, we have only made one prediction based on Customer One's responses.  How can we improve each subsequent prediction, based on each customer's responses, until our prediction error is zero, the white ball is at the bottom, and our fabulous network is trained enough to make good use of our new dataset of hot prospects that were provided by the (smitten) veterinarian?\n",

        "Gradient descent is the master plan to change the weights of the synapses so as to maximize the reduction in error accomplished by each iteration.  OK, well...here is a better explanation For Normal People: Roll the damn ball down the steepest slope to get to the bottom of the bowl as fast as possible.  Back propagation is the method used to compute the gradient, which is just a fancy word for slope.  When you start at Point A, it is Back Propagation that tells you the slope of the surface of the bowl under the white ball.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Slope? Yes, my dears, it's ALL ABOUT SLOPE.  All your fancy experts throw around the term, \"gradient descent,\" but \"gradient\" just means slope.  Finding the slope of the bowl's surface, where our ball lies, tells us the direction our ball should roll to make the quickest descent to the bottom of the bowl where error is 0 (i.e., where our ball would be touching the syn0, syn1 grid plane).  \n",
        "\n",
        "Now, let's make a key distinction as we continue down the path of you becoming a genius:  Gradient descent is the master plan, and Back Propagation is the main tool for achieving that plan.  Here's what I mean:  \n",
        "\n",
        "####Gradient Descent is the Master Plan\n",
        "It changes the weights to reduce the error in our prediction with each iteration.  \n",
        "\n",
        "What is a \"weight?\"  That's an important concept.  Weights are the values (the numbers) in our synapse matrices (there are 12 in syn0 and 4 in syn1).  Each line you saw connecting neurons in the diagram above is a synapse, aka a weight.  Think of a weight as \"a number that quantifies how important a given feature is to the prediction.\"  If a weight is a big value (whether positive or negative), that means \"this feature in layer 0 has a big impact on its corresponding feature in layer 1.\"  In other words, \"this feature/question is a big contributor to an accurate prediction in l2.\"  If a weight is close to zero, that means this feature/question is largely irrelevant to making accurate predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "####Back Propagation is the Main Tool for Achieving Gradient Descent\n",
        "Back propagation is the method we use to compute the gradient, and that gradient value then tells us how much to re-prioritize each weight (i.e., each relationship between feature questions) in the next iteration.  Each point on the dotted line as it descends to the bottom of the bowl is one iteration of the neural network.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, what is an iteration?  **That's** a key question.  The first part of an iteration is our feed forward, which we saw above.  It is the feed forward that gets our white ball to its starting position at Point A, from whence it rolls down the curvy surface of our red bowl towards the bottom, which sits on the white grid, where \"Accurate Prediction\" lives (i.e., 0 in the cost function, the global minimum).  Each dot of that dotted white path represents a tweak, or update of the prediction weights assigned to syn0 and syn1.  Each iteration begins with a fresh feed forward that moves the ball slightly to a new position in the bowl.\n",

        "Here's the key thing to visualize: the path of our white ball as it rolls down the inside surface of our curvy red bowl is erratic.  You can see that the ball rolls over some bumps, rolls into some ravines, changes direction suddenly, etc.  To understand what's happening, let's start with our vertical axis first and imagine the yellow arrow (which is our vertical, Z coordinate and equals the error between our current prediction and The Actual Truth found in y) moves with the ball and always remains under the ball as it rolls erratically down the side of the bowl.  The yellow arrow therefore has many changes in length, and also in the location of its base on the white grid below the bowl.  So, with each lurch the white ball makes along the surface of the red bowl, there is also a corresponding lurch of the yellow arrow as it lurches along the white grid below.  As the white ball gets closer to the bottom of the bowl, the yellow arrow gets shorter and shorter until it reaches zero, where there is zero difference between our prediction and The Actual Truth found in y.  That means our prediction is accurate.  So when the yellow arrow equals zero, our horizontal coordinates of syn0 and syn1 on the X and Y axes must be right under the bottom of the bowl (aka the global minimum).  \n",
        "\n",
        "To sum up: as the yellow arrow gets shorter and shorter, its horizontal coordinates on the white grid get closer-and-closer to arriving right under the red bowl's bottom (which in this diagram looks to be about (3,0)).  Make sense?\n",
        "\n",
        "Since syn0 and syn1 are the X and Y axes of the white grid, therefore each adjustment of the values of those coordinates is what brings the white ball to the bowl's bottom, i.e., less error and greater accuracy.  The \"learning\" process of reducing error takes place in the synapses of the neural network pictured in my first diagram above--not the neurons.\n",

You see, the experts already know this, and they (mistakenly) assume that you know it too.  This is the \"expert blindness\" I mentioned at the beginning of this article.

        "You will see the word \"matrix\" or matrices in the code below.  This is VERY important: the matrix is the engine of our car.  Without matrices, a neural network goes nowhere.  At all.  \n",
        "\n",
        "A matrix is a set of rows of numbers.  For a quick-and-dirty metaphor, think of a glorified XL spreadsheet.  Or a database with many rows and many columns of numbers.  The first matrix you will now meet holds the data from our pet shop customer survey.  It looks like this:\n",

        "[0,0,1],\n",
        "[1,1,1]\n",
        "```\n",
        "Think of each row as one customer, so there are four customers in the matrix above.  Each row contains three numbers (1's and 0's for Yes and No) between brackets, right?  And you may recall in Section 1.2 above we already saw Customer One's responses of, \"Yes/No/Yes\" to the three survey questions, hence the top row of 1, 0 ,1 in the matrix above.  And column one contains our four customers' responses to question one, \"Do you own a cat?\" (i.e., Customers Two and Three do *not* own a cat, hence the zero's).  Now, to fill in a little more detail, here's the exact same matrix as above, but with some labels and some color coding to emphasize how one customer's responses are a row and one feature/question is a column: \n",

        "\n",
        "Hopefully, the above diagram clarifies a key point that really confused me at first: it is the relationship between rows of customers and columns of features.  You have to see a matrix as both.  Let's break it down:\n",
        "\n",
        "In our matrix, one customer's data is represented by a ROW of three numbers, right?  And in a neural network diagram with all those circular neurons connected by lines of synapses, the input layer is a column containing three circular \"neurons,\" right?  Well, it's important to notice that each neuron does NOT represent a customer--a ROW of data.  Rather, each neuron represents a FEATURE--a COLUMN of data.  So, within a neuron, we have *all* the customers' answers to the same question/feature, e.g., \"Do you own a cat?\"  We're only charting four customers, so in my diagram above, you only see four 1's and 0's that are responses to that question.  But if we were charting 1,000,000 customers, that top neuron would contain one million 1's and 0's representing each customer's Yes/No response to feature one, \"Do you own a cat?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "So I hope it's becoming clear why we need matrices:  Because we have more than one customer.  In our toy neural network below, we describe four customers, so we need four rows of numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our network also has more than one survey question.  So we need one column per survey question (aka, per feature), thus we have three columns here representing the responses to the first three questions of our survey (the fourth question appears in a different matrix that we'll see later).  \n",
        "\n",
        "So our matrix is tiny: 4 rows X 3 columns, known as a \"4 by 3.\"  But the matrices in real neural networks can have millions of customers and hundreds of survey questions (features).  Or the neural networks that do image recognition in photos or video can have billions of rows of \"customers\" and billions of columns of features.  \n",
        "\n",
        "In sum, we need matrices to keep all our data straight while we do complex calculations on it, so a matrix organizes our data into nice, neat little rows and columns (usually, not so little at all).  Good enough for now?  Let's move on.   \n",

        "\n",
        "\"nonlin()\" is a type of sigmoid function called a logistic function.  Logistic functions are very commonly used in science, statistics, and probability.  This particular sigmoid function is written in a more complicated way than necessary here because it serves two functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "Function #1 of 2 is to take a matrix (represented here by a small x) within its parentheses and convert each value to a number between 0 and 1 (aka a statistical probability).  This is done by line 12: `return 1/(1+np.exp(-x))` \n",
        "\n",
        "Why do we need statistical probabilities?  Well, remember that our network doesn't predict in just 0's and 1's, right?  Our network's prediction doesn't shout, \"YES!  Customer One WILL ABSOLUTELY buy Litter Rip! if she knows what's good for her!\"  Rather, our network predicts the probability: \"There's a 74% chance Customer One will buy Litter Rip!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "This is an important distinction because if you predict in 0's and 1's, there's no way to improve.  You're either right or wrong.  Period.  But with a probability, there's room for improvement.  You can tweak the system to increase or decrease that probability a few decimal points each time, so you can improve your accuracy.  It's a controlled, incremental process, rather than just blind guessing in the dark.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will see below that this is very important, because this conversion to a number between zero and one gives us **FOUR** very **big advantages**.

Well, our goal is a neural network that confidently makes accurate predictions.  The fastest way to achieve that goal is to fix the non-confident, wishy-washy, low-accuracy predictions, while leaving the accurate,  confident predictions alone.

Well, the function np.random.random produces random numbers uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 (with a corresponding mean of 0.5).  But we want this initialization to have a mean of zero.  Why?  So that the initial weight numbers in this matrix do not have an a-priori bias towards values of 1 or 0, because this would imply a confidence that we do not yet have (i.e. in the beginning, the network has no idea what is going on so it should display no confidence in its predictions until we update it after each iteration).  \n",

        "So, how do we convert a set of numbers with an average of 0.5 to a set with a mean of 0?  We first double all the random numbers (resulting in a distribution between 0 and 2 with mean 1), and then we subtract one (resulting in a distribution between -1 and 1 with mean 0).  That's why you see `2*` at the beginning of our equation, and - 1 at the end.  This changes the mean from 0.5 to 0.  Nice: `2*np.random.random((3,4)) - 1`\n",

Look at the diagram: whatever numbers that are in the top neuron of l1 have to be multiplied only once, right?  Because there's only one line (weight) connecting the top neuron of l1 to the single neuron of l2.  And we know that the top neuron of l1 has four values in it, right?  Therefore, 4 values x 1 weight = four products.  Add them together and that gives you the first product inside l2.  \n",

You see, many of the matrices above have realistic initial values as if they were just created from randomized seeding by the computer.

In our example, l0,2 x syn0,2= 0 x something = 0, so it doesn't matter.  But l0,3 x syn0,3 *does* matter because l0,3=1, so let's just make up a simple, convenient value for syn0,3 of 0.16.  Therefore, l0,3 x syn0,3 = 1 x 0.16 = 0.16.  Our product of l0,1 x syn0,1 + our product of l0,3 x syn0,3 = 3.66 + 0.16 = 3.82, and 3.82 is l1_LH.  Next, we have to run l1_LH through our nonlin() function to create a probability between 0 and 1.  Nonlin(l1_LH) uses the code, `return 1/(1+np.exp(-x))`, so in our example that would be: 1/(1+(2.718^-3.82))=0.98, so l1 (the RH side of the l1 node) is 0.98.\n",

But again, don't forget that to 11.97 we have to add all the products of all the other l1 neurons times their corresponding syn1 weights, so for simplicity's sake trust me that they all added up to -11.97.  So you end up with 11.97 + -11.97 = 0.00, which is l2_LH.  Next we run l2_LH through our fabulous nonlin() function, which would be: 1/(1+2.718^-(0)) = 0.5, which is l2, which is our very first prediction of what the truth, y, might be!  Congratulations!

Therefore, we could infer that these customers will buy Litter Rip! just to enjoy the beautiful, tasteful design and ergonomic form of each stink-sucking granule of kitty litter, so they'll buy the product just to display it proudly on their mantle, even if their cat only poops outdoors, right?

And if they visit websites online, and everything, well gosh--then they are obviously tech-savvy geniuses.  So we can infer that technologically sophisticated customers will clamor to buy Litter Rip! just out of sheer admiration for the bleeding-edge technology that goes into each granule of poop-absorber--even if the customer doesn't actually own a cat.

Over 60,000 iterations, it will become clear that, for example, cat owners who visit Litter Rip! online are more likely to buy Litter Rip! so the corresponding weights will get larger over iterations, meaning the statistical probability will be closer to 1 than 0.  But imported beer drinkers who don't own a cat are less likely to buy Litter Rip! so those weights will get smaller--meaning that statistical probability will be closer to 0 than to 1.

In other words, certain values in the synapse matrices of our network need to be increased or decreased in order to give a better prediction next time.  To adjust each of these values, we must answer two key questions:\n",

But if you want to visualize what gradient descent does, simply remember that \"gradient\" is just a fancy word for \"slope.\"  If you remember our curvy red bowl from Section 1, The Big Picture, gradient descent simply means calculating the optimal slope of the surface of that bowl to get that little white ball down to the bottom of the bowl as quickly and efficiently as possible.  So keep that curvy red bowl in your mind.\n",

Well, with Customer One (Row One of l0), we want to compare our l2 prediction to the y value of 1, since Customer did indeed buy Litter Rip!

        "##4.5) How the Slope-Taking Feature of the Sigmoid Function Gives You Confidence Measures\n",
        "Here is where you will see the beauty of the sigmoid function in four *magical* operations.  To me, the genius of our neural network's ability to learn is found largely in these four, very advantageous, operations:  \n",
        "\n",
        "We saw in Section 2 of 5 how the `nonlin()` transformed each value of l2_LH into a statistical probability (i.e., a prediction) between 0 and 1 (aka l2).  This is ***Big Advantage #1*** of the ***Four Big Advantages of the Sigmoid Function:***  \n",
        "\n",
        "But I have yet to explain how Part 2 of the sigmoid, namely \"`nonlin(l2,deriv=True)`\" can transform those 4 values in l2 into confidence measures.  This is ***Big Advantage #2.***  If each of our network's predictions, the four values of l2, are both high-accuracy and high-confidence, then that's an outstanding prediction, and we want to leave the syn0 and syn1 weights that contributed to that outstanding prediction alone.  We don't want to mess with what's working; we want to fix what's NOT working.  Below I'll teach you how \"`nonlin(l2,deriv=True)`\" shows us which weights require our attention.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Confidence measures help us to prioritize which weights we want to mess with first.  How?  Well, if \"`nonlin(l2,deriv=True)`\" produces a confidence measure of 0.999, that's the equivalent of the network saying \"I am extremely confident the customer will buy Litter Rip!.\"  A number of 0.001 is the equivalent of \"I'm confident there is no way in Hell the customer will buy Litter Rip!.\"  But what about all those numbers in the middle?  Low confidence numbers are in the vicinity of 0.5.  For example, a value of 0.6 would be similar to \"The customer might buy Litter Rip!, but I'm not sure.\"  0.5 means, \"Hey--it could go either way, I'm on the fence...\"\n",
        "\n",
        "That's why we focus our attention on the numbers in the middle:  all numbers approaching 0.5 in the middle are wishy-washy, and lacking confidence.  So, how can we tweak our network to produce four l2 values that are both high-confidence and high-accuracy?  \n",
        "\n",
        "The key lies in the values, or ***weights*** of syn0 and syn1.  As I mentioned above, syn0 and syn1 are the center, the absolute *brains* of our neural network.  We are going to take the four values of the l2_error and perform beautiful, elegant math on them to produce an l2_delta.  l2_delta means, basically, \"the change we want to see in the output of the network (l2) so that it better resembles y (the truth about who bought Litter Rip!).\"  In other words, l2_delta is the change you want to see in l2 in the next feed forward pass in the next iteration.\n",

For example, let's say value 1 of l2 is 0.9.  If we search for 0.9 on the Y axis of the graph below, we can see that it corresponds with a point on the S curve roughly where you see the green dot: ![alt text](https://iamtrask.github.io/img/sigmoid-deriv-2.png)\n",

You don't need to know calculus to take the slope of a curve at a particular point--the computer will do that for you.  But you do have to notice that the S curve above has very shallow slope at both the upper extreme (near 1) and the lower extreme (near 0).  Does that sound familiar?  Wonder of wonders, a shallow slope on the sigmoid curve coincides with high confidence in our predictions!\n",

And here comes ***Big Advantage #4*** of the ***Four Big Advantages of the Sigmoid Function:*** Miracle-of-miracles, our high-confidence numbers correspond to shallow slope on the S-curve, which corresponds to tiny slope numbers.

The smallest slope numbers indicate the highest confidence level.  Therefore, multiplying the corresponding values of the l2_error by these small numbers ain't gonna cause a big change in the l2_delta product, which is good.

When we update syn1 later on, that bigger multiplier is going to mean a bigger product, and therefore a bigger change, or tweak, in that value.  This is as it should be, because we want to take the weights we have the least confidence in and change them the most.  That's where we will get the biggest \"bang for our buck\" when it comes to tweaking the 16 weights of our system.  To summarize, taking the slope of l2 gives us the confidence of each l2 prediction, which allows us to home in on the numbers that most need fixing, and fix them the fastest.\n",

For example, cat owners who visit Litter Rip!.com are likely to buy, while non-cat owners who drink imported beer are less likely to buy.  Well, my dearies, that's what l2_delta is doing here.  l2_delta is increasing the importance (the weight) of the most useful inferred questions in layer two, and decreasing the importance of the less useful inferred questions.  And below, we'll go through exactly the same process as we determine the usefulness of each inferred question in \"hidden layer\" #1 (\"Hidden\"?  Hah!

And we can see how l2_delta is the distance between our current prediction and the prediction we will make in our next iteration.  So learning this Big Miss/Small Miss idea just above helps us understand how to tweak our current syn1 in line 115 of the code below--we just multiply our current syn 1 by our new-found l2_delta and it will make big adjustments where we had big misses, and make small adjustments where our prediction was pretty accurate and pretty confident.\n",

But with l1_error, things are different. We don't know what \"The Ideal l1\" is. There's no y to tell us that. y only tells us The Ideal l2.\n",

        "###Returning (Yet Again) to those Super-Key Inferred Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "It comes back to the concept of inferred questions (features), and combinations of feature questions that we discussed in 3.4 and 4.5.  When we change the weights in syn1, what we're really doing is experimenting with the importance we want to attach to this question versus that question, or some other combination of other questions.  Likewise with syn0:  we are looking for math that will help us find l1_error because l1_error tells us which questions we *mistakenly* prioritized or *mistakenly* combined.  And when we next calculate l1_delta, the l1_delta will tell us a **better** set of priorities and combinations of questions for our next iteration.  \n",
        "\n",
        "For example, perhaps syn0 started out with weights suggesting that the inferred question of \"Is this person rich?\" was a very important question.  (For example, perhaps this question was inferred from some combination of the two questions, 1) \"Own a cat?\" because cat owners of course tend to be millionaires, and 2) \"Drink imported beer?\" because imported beer drinkers are willing and able to pay the extra $20 per bottle, rather than settling for Coors Light.)\n",
        "\n",
        "However, as training went on, the network realized that Litter Rip! isn't a luxury good, so being rich isn't important, and thus the network adjusted the values of syn0 to downplay the inferred question, \"Is this person rich?\"  How did the network downplay this inferred question?  By multiplying the question's corresponding value in syn0 by a large l1_delta value that has a negative sign in front of it.  Next, perhaps the network upgraded an *emerging* inferred question, \"Does this person have allergies to stinky cat poop?\"  It would upgrade that question by multiplying the corresponding syn0 value by a large and *positive* l1_delta value.\n",
        "\n",
        "OK, so perhaps the above two questions evolve in priority.  But perhaps another inferred question, \"Does this person know how to buy things on the internet?\" has consistently seemed important the whole time because your target audience is folks who feel comfortable making online purchases.  So the network multiplies *this* question's corresponding syn0 value by a tiny l1_delta value.  Therefore, it's relative priority remains unchanged.  It ain't broke, so don't fix it!  It's already working well.\n",
        "\n",
        "Well then: we know that changing the values of syn0 will change which of our inferred questions increases of decreases as a factor contributing to l1's overall contribution to accurate predictions in l2.  And syn1 takes the combination of feature questions and further refines them to make a more accurate l2.\n",
        "\n",
        "And **that,** me lovelies, is why we are looking for math that will help us adjust syn0 to give us a better l1, which in turn leads to a better l2:  the better we sort our feature/question combinations in l1, the easier it is to refine them with syn1 to give us a fantastic l2.  \n",

When we multiply that larger number by the l2_error then the resulting l2_delta has a bigger number.  When we update syn1 later on, that bigger multiplier is going to mean a bigger product, and therefore a bigger change, or tweak, in that value.  This is as it should be, because we want to take the weights we have the least confidence in and change them the most.  That's where we will get the biggest \"bang for our buck\" when it comes to tweaking the 16 weights of our system.  To summarize, taking the slope of l2 gives us the confidence of each l2 prediction, which allows us to home in on the numbers that most need fixing, and fix them the fastest.\n",

But, for simplicity's sake, let's pretend that the bowl in the middle is the global minimum.  So, a steep slope downwards to the right (i.e., a negative slope value, as depicted by the green line in the picture) means our ball will roll a lot in the negative direction (i.e., to the right), causing a big, negative adjustment to the corresponding weights of syn1 that will be used in the next iteration to predict l2.  In other words, some of the four l2 values will approach zero and a probability prediction that the customer in question did NOT buy Litter Rip!.\n",

        "However, if for example you have a shallow slope downwards to the left, that would mean the prediction value is already accurate and confident, which produces a tiny, positive slope value, so the ball will roll very little to the left (i.e., in a positive direction), thus adjusting by very little the corresponding weight in syn1, so the next iteration's prediction of that value will remain largely unchanged.  This makes sense because, as the network's predictions become more accurate, the back-and-forth motion of the rolling ball is becoming smaller and smaller before it soon comes to rest at the global minimum, the bottom of the bowl, so there's no need to move much.  It is already close to the ideal.\n",

In other words, we're not just comparing how a single number 3.66 in syn0,1 affects a single number 0.5 in l2_error.  We want to compare how a *change* in the number 3.66 in syn0,1 will in turn change the 5 rippling ratios to ultimately create a better, future l2_error.  Specifically, we want to make that 0.5 value smaller, as quickly as possible.

Our code is not asking for any slopes/derivatives because it is a linear function (which looks like a straight line on a graph), so the distance between coordinates can be very large and the slope will still be exactly right.  For curvy functions (parabolas, sigmoids, etc) the points should be close together to minimize the effect of curvature on your estimate of the slope.  Thus, for our nearby's on this linear function, we can use numbers that are, well...convenient, rather than nearby.  Hence: x_nearby is 4 and y_nearby is 4.16.
