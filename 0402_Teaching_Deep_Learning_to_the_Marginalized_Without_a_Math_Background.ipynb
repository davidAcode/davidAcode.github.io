        "The best teacher is the person who just learned yesterday the stuff you are studying today, because he still remembers what he struggled with and how he overcame it, and he can pass those shortcuts on to you.  That \"he\" would be me.  Let's jump in:\n",
        "\n",
        "#1) Congratulations!  You are the wealthy owner of a fabulous pet shop...  \n",
        "One month ago, you launched a new kitty litter product, cleverly named, \"Litter Rip!\"  A big part of your success comes from your savvy use of AI to send targeted advertisements to the right potential new customers.  You seek folks whose beloved felines would be pleased to, \"let 'er rip,\" so to speak, upon your new cat toilet.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your secret weapon is your dataset.  You have data from surveys of your pet shop customers in the past month since you starting selling Litter Rip! in your store.  These customer surveys include their answers to four stunningly insightful questions:  \n",
        "1. Do you own a cat who poops?\n",
        "2. Do you drink imported beer?\n",
        "3. In the past month, have you visited our award-winning website, LitterRip!.com?\n",
        "4. In the past month, have you purchased Litter Rip! for your poopin' puss?\n",
        "\n",
        "The answers to these four questions are known as \"features,\" (characteristics) of your past customers.  It's important to understand that a neural network always trains on one dataset in order to make predictions on another dataset.  So first, you will train your network by inputting millions of past, overjoyed customers and their Yes/No answers to the first **three** of the above insightful questions/features.  Your neural network will calculate which of these features (or combinations thereof) were most important to past customers who bought Litter Rip! for their puss.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Most thrillingly, your neural network will train itself, based solely on your old customers' answers to the above three questions, until it becomes **awesome** at predicting which of your old customers probably did buy Litter Rip!  The process is trial-and-error:  the network will predict, then compare its predictions to the list of old customers who actually **did** buy Litter Rip! (i.e., our fourth question above: \"Purchased Litter Rip! in the past month?\"), and learn from its mistakes over 60,000 iterations.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Once your network is fabulous at predicting purchasers of Litter Rip! from the past customers database, then, you can turn it loose on your *other* dataset, a list of hot prospects.  From your local veterinarian (who is secretly in love with you, you charmer...) you have obtained a fresh batch of surveys of people who have answered the same first three questions, and your by-now-well-trained network will predict who best to send your targeted ad to.  Pure genius!  OMG, how do you *do* it?\n",
        "\n",
        "The best way to master Deep Learning is to build a neural network and then memorize the code, because then you can apply these fundamentals to any network you meet in future academic papers or work projects.  It all starts here.  Today you will build your first neural network using these tools:\n",

        "3.   The Sigmoid, a simple activation function, calculates probability and confidence levels;\n",
        "4.   Back Propagation tells you which parts of your network to tweak to reduce your error; and\n",

        "Let me help you get your bearings in this diagram.  This is a three-layer, feed-forward neural network.  The input layer is on the left: the three circles represent neurons (sometimes known as nodes or features).  You may recall our first three questions above represent our three features.  So for now, think of that column of three questions as representing one customer's responses.  The top circle on the left contains the answer to the question, \"Do you own a cat who poops?\"  The middle circle of the three contains the answer to, \"Do you drink imported beer?\"  The bottom circle of the input layer is the feature, \"Have you visited our website, LitterRip!.com?\"  So, if Customer One responded, \"Yes/No/Yes\" to the questions, the top circle would contain a 1, the middle circle would contain a 0, and the bottom circle would contain a 1.\n",

        "The synapses (all those lines) and the hidden layer above are where our brain does its \"thinking.\"  The single circle on the right-hand side (the one still attached to four synapses) is the network's prediction, which says, \"Based on the combination of answers input into me, here is the probability that this customer will indeed buy Litter Rip! (or not).\"  The predicted probability will be between 0 and 1.  For example, an output prediction of 0.00001 means, \"Definitely won't buy,\"  0.2 means \"Probably wont buy,\" 0.8 is \"Probably will buy,\" and 0.999 is, \"You're damn right they'll buy Litter Rip! with joy in their hearts!\" \n",

Our neural network will output a prediction of probability, compare it to y to see how accurate it was, and learn from its mistakes in the next iteration.  Trial-and-error.  60,000 times.  In seconds.  That's the power of Deep Learning.\n",

        "In the diagram above, our network begins its predictions about kitty litter buyers at the top of the dotted, white line on the surface of the warped, lumpy red bowl.  That point is very important, so let's call it Point A.  Think of Point A as the first prediction the network makes.  This is the first forward feed.  What most AI courses and blogs forget to mention is that Point A has a location defined by two coordinates on the white grid underneath the lumpy red bowl.  Notice that the lumpy bowl is not drifting in space.  It is sitting on a white grid. Think of that white grid as a table top, and our warped red bowl actually sits on the table top, but the bowl's only point of contact with the table top is the very bottom-most dip in the bowl--the point where the dotted white line ends.  (I know the bowl would be too lopsided to actually sit properly, but humor me--this is just a quick-and-dirty analogy).    \n",
        "\n",
        "Now, pretend Point A is a little, white ball.  It has 3 coordinates: the X and Y axes tell you location on the grid (table top), and the third coordinate is the height from the grid to Point A as it sits on the inner surface of the warped, red bowl.  Here's  a super-key insight: the two orange arrows you see, representing the X and Y axes on the grid, are actually the synapses syn0 and syn1 that you will learn about below.  As I eyeball Point A, its coordinates look like (3,3) to me, so for let's say syn0 is 3 and syn1 is 3 (I'm oversimplifying here on purpose).\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's where it gets cool: remember Customer One's Yes/No/Yes responses to the first three questions?  The network takes that 1,0,1 of Customer One, multiplies it by the synapses of syn0 and syn1 (plus some other fancy jazz), and makes a prediction: let's say, 0.7.  In other words, there is a 70% probability that Customer One bought Litter Rip!  Then the network compares that prediction, 0.7, to The Truth, y, which is 1.  Customer One did indeed buy Litter Rip! (a wise choice).  \n",
        "\n",
        "And now things get super-cool:  Do you see that yellow, verticle arrow?  If I were drawing this diagram, I would have put that yellow arrow right under Point A--namely, at about (3,3) as I eyeball things.  If the vertical, yellow arrow were located just underneath Point A, then it would represent the 3rd coordinate, the height from Point A to its two coordinates on the white grid, syn0 and syn1, or (3,3).  This height equals the error of that first prediction--how much it missed The Truth by, therefore the y survey answer of Yes, or 1, minus the prediction of 0.7 equals an error of 0.3.  That yellow arrow would have a \"length\" of 0.3!  Ain't that cool?  We can see how the network thinks in terms of simple, 3-D geometry.  You just witnessed a complete Forward Feed.  You're a rock star.\n",
        "\n",
        "And it gets better.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of a neural network is to find the fastest, most direct path for the white ball down from the original Point A to the bottom-most dip of the warped, red bowl--the point that sits on the table top.  That is Utopia folks--the place where the yellow arrow, the error in our predictions, would equal zero in length, meaning our predictions have no error and therefore our network would be stunningly accurate.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, consider our scenario now: we started at the top of that white, dotted line, where Point A's height (the yellow arrow, the amount of error in our first prediction) equals 0.3.  How do we roll the ball down the bowl to get to the bottom, where the yellow arrow, the amount of error) is zero?  In other words, how do we tweak our original synapses of (3,3) so that their coordinates will move on the grid to the point *right* under the bowl's bottom, at (roughly) (3,0)?  So far, we have only made one prediction based on Customer One's responses.  How can we improve each subsequent prediction, based on each customer's responses, until our prediction error is zero, the white ball is at the bottom, and our fabulous network is trained enough to take on our new dataset of hot prospects that were provided by the (smitten) veterinarian?\n",
        "\n",
        "To repeat: our goal is for our small, white ball of Point A to roll down the lumpy bowl as depicted in the diagram by the dotted white line, which represents our network's journey from its first, not-so-great prediction of 0.7 to the final, 60,000th prediction, which is as accurate as possible.  To find that step-by-step path down the surface of the bowl to the bottom is the process of Gradient Descent.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a key ingredient of Gradient Descent:  When you start at Point A, it is Back Propagation that tells you the slope of the surface of the bowl at Point A.  Finding the slope of the bowl's surface, where our ball lies, tells us the direction our ball should roll to make the quickest descent to the bottom of the bowl where error is 0 because our ball would be touching the syn0, syn1 grid plane.  Each step of that dotted white line is an iteration of the neural network.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, what is an iteration?  **That's** a key question.  Our white ball, Point A, rolls down our lumpy red bowl towards the bottom, which sits on the white grid, where \"Accurate Prediction\" lives.  Each dot of that dotted white path represents a tweak, or update of the weights syn0 and syn1.  Here's the key thing to visualize: the path of our white ball in the three-dimensional bowl is bumpy and erratic.  But if you envision the path of the white ball on the two-dimensional white grid underneath, our white ball is essentially inching its way across that flat grid towards the bottom of the red bowl, where error is zero and acurracy reigns.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Since syn0 and syn1 are the X and Y axes of the white grid, therefore each adjustment of those coordinates is what brings the white ball to the bowl's bottom, i.e., less error and greater accuracy.  The \"learning\" process of reducing error takes place in the synapses of the neural network pictured in my first diagram above--not the neurons.\n",
        "\n",
        "This next diagram may also be helpful in envisioning the geometry of neural networks.  It's essentially another version of the same, red bowl above, but from a slightly different angle:\n",
        "\n",
        "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_YXtTs4vPh33avOFi5xxTaHEzRWPx2Hmr4ehAxEdVhg/edit?usp=sharing\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is a perfect example of why the best teacher is someone who learned yesterday the material you are learning today:  Over the past year of studying AI, I had seen the bowl analogy many times, but NO ONE mentioned the significance of the bowl sitting on the grid, or what the grid was, or the significance of the height from the grid to Point A.  You see, all the experts already know this, and they (mistakenly) assume that you know it too.  So please learn from my mistake, and gain a super-key insight that eluded me for over a year, even though it was right under my nose.  \n",
        "\n",
        "And that's it.  That is the best geometric representation of what a neural network does, in one picture.  Why doesn't EVERYBODY teach it like this?  If you can SEE what a neural network does in 3-D, it makes it SO much easier to understand why we do all these abstract steps with math and with code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Again: if you understood nothing of the above diagram and analogy, no worries.  I'm going to fill in all the details below, but at least now you know exactly where we're headed!  Godspeed.\n",

        "Here's a key point that really confused me at first: in our matrix, one customer's data is represented by a ROW of three numbers, right?  And in a neural network diagram like the first picture I showed you at the beginning of this article, the input layer is a column containing three circular \"neurons,\" right?  Well, it's important to notice that each neuron does NOT represent a customer--a ROW of data.  Rather, each neuron represents a FEATURE--a COLUMN of data.  So, within a neuron, we have *all* the customers' answers to the same question/feature, e.g., \"Do you own a cat?\"  We're only charting four customers, so in my diagram above, you only see four 1's and 0's that are responses to that question.  But if we were charting 1,000,000 customers, that top neuron would contain one million 1's and 0's representing each customer's Yes/No response to feature one, \"Do you own a cat?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "So I hope it's becoming clear why we need matrices:  Because we have more than one customer.  In our toy neural network below, we describe four customers, so we need four rows of numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our network also has more than one survey question.  So we need one column per survey question (aka, per feature), thus we have three columns here representing the responses to the first three questions of our survey (the fourth question appears in a different matrix that we'll see later).  \n",
        "\n",
        "So our matrix is tiny: 4 rows X 3 columns, known as a \"4 by 3.\"  But the matrices in real neural networks can have millions of customers and hundreds of survey questions (features).  Or the neural networks that do image recognition in photos or video can have billions of rows of \"customers\" and billions of columns of features.  \n",
        "\n",
        "In sum, we need matrices to keep all our data straight while we do complex calculations on it, so a matrix organizes our data into nice, neat little rows and columns (usally, not so little at all).  Good enough for now?  Let's move on.   \n",

        "Let's go through each of the 13 steps of the code in detail:\n",
        "\n",
        "##1) The Sigmoid Function, Briefly Mentioned: lines 6-11:\n",
        "The sigmoid function plays a super-important role in making our network learn, but don't worry if you don't understand it all yet.  This is only our first pass over the material.  I'll explain it in detail below in Step 10.  For now, just do your best:\n",
        "\n",
        "\"nonlin()\" is a type of sigmoid function called a logistic function.  Logistic functions are very commonly used in science, statistics, and probability.  This particular Sigmoid function is written in a more complicated way than necessary here because it serves two functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) to take each of the matrices within its parentheses and convert each value to a number between 0 and 1 (aka a statistical probability).  This is done by line 11: `return 1/(1+np.exp(-x))` \n",
        "\n",
        "Why do we need statistical probabilites?  Well, remember that our network doesn't predict in just 0's and 1's, right?  Our network's prediction doesn't shout, \"YES!  Customer One WILL ABSOLUTELY buy Litter Rip! if she knows what's good for her!\"  Rather, our network predicts the probability: \"There's a 74% chance Customer One will buy Litter Rip!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "This is an important distinction because if you predict in 0's and 1's, there's no way to improve.  You're either right or wrong.  Period.  But with a probability, there's room for improvement.  You can tweak the system to increase or decrease that probability a few decimal points each time, so you can improve your accuracy.  It's a controlled, incremental process, rather than just blind guessing in the dark.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will see below that this is very important, because this conversion to a 0-1 number gives us **FOUR** very **big advantages**.  I will discuss these four in detail below, but for now, just know that the sigmoid function converts every number in every matrix within its parentheses into a number between 0 and 1 that falls somewhere on the S-curve illustrated here:\n",

        "\n",
        "So, Part 1 of the Sigmoid function has converted each value in the matrix into a statistical probability, which is also known as a confidence measure.  In other words, the number answers the question, \"how confident are we that this number correctly predicts an outcome?\"  You may wonder, So what?  Well, our goal is a neural network that confidently makes accurate predictions.  The fastest way to achieve that goal is to fix the non-confident, wishy-washy, low-accuracy predictions, while leaving the good predictions alone.  Remember this concept of wishy-washy, non-confident numbers.  It will be important below.\n",

In our example, l0,2 x syn0,2= 0 x something = 0, so it doesn't matter.  But l0,3 x syn0,3 *does* matter because l0,3=1, so let's just make up a simple, convenient value for syn0,3 of 3.  Therefore, l0,3 x syn0,3 = 1 x 3 = 3  Our product of l0,1 x syn0,1 + our product of l0,3 x syn0,3 = 2+3 = 5, and 5 is l1_LH.  Next, we have to run l1_LH through our nonlin() function to create a probability between 0 and 1.  Nonlin(l1_LH) uses the code, `return 1/(1+np.exp(-x))`, so in our example that would be: 5/(1+(2.718^-5))=0.98, so l1 (the RH side of the l1 node) is 0.98.\n",

But again, don't forget that to 2.94 we have to add all the products of all the other l1 neurons times their corresponding syn1 weights, so for simplicity's sake we'll just pretend those all added up to -2.  So you end up with -2 + 2.94 = 0.94, which is l2_LH.  Next we run l2_LH through our fabulous nonlin() function, which would be: 1/(1+2.718^-(-2)) = ~0.7, which is l2, which is our very first prediction of what the truth, y, might be!  Congratulations!

        "#Step 2: How the Slope-Taking Feature of the Sigmoid Function Gives You Confidence Levels\n",
        "Here is where you will see the beauty of the Sigmoid function in four *magical* steps.  To me, the genius of our neural network's ability to learn is found largely in these four steps.  We saw how, in line 39, Step 1 was when the `nonlin()` transformed each value of our matrix into a statistical probability (i.e., a prediction) between 0 and 1.  But I have yet to mention that that statistical probability is ***also*** a simple measure of confidence--numbers approaching 1 suggest high confidence that the NN's (neural network's) prediction of \"1\" is correct.  Numbers approaching 0 suggest high confidence that the NN's prediction of \"0\" is correct.  This is ***Big Advantage #2*** of the ***Four Big Advantages of the Sigmoid Function:***  If our NN's prediction, the four values of l2, is high-confidence and high-accuracy, that's an oustanding prediction, and we want to leave the syn0 and syn1 weights that produced that oustanding prediction alone.  We don't want to mess with what's working; we want to fix what's NOT working.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let me explain the above from a different angle: right now, ournetworkis dealing with a pretty abstract problem, i.e., 1's and 0's.  Let's give those 1's and 0's meaning: imagine that our problem is one of image recognition, e.g., \"Is there a fish in this image?  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\"1\" means, Yes, and \"0\" means No. Within this context, the output is simultaneously a prediction and a confidence measure.  An output of 0.999 is the equivalent of the network saying \"I am extremely confident the customer will buy Litter Rip!.\"  A number of 0.001 is the equivalent of \"There is no way in Hell the customer will buy Litter Rip!.\"  Low confidence numbers are in the vicinity of 0.5.  For example, a value of 0.4 would be similar to \"The customer might buy Litter Rip!, but I'm not sure.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "That's why we focus our attention on the numbers in the middle:  all numbers approaching 0.5 in the middle are wishy-washy, and lacking confidence.  So, how can we tweak ournetworkto produce four l2 values that are both high-confidence and high-accuracy?  \n",
        "\n",
        "The key lies in the values, or ***weights*** of syn0 and syn1.  As I mentioned above, syn0 and syn1 are the center, the absolute *brains* or our neural network.  We are going to take the four values of the l2_error and perform beautiful, elegant math on them to produce an l2_delta.  l2_delta means, basically, \"the change we want to see in the output of the network (l2) so that it better resembles y (the truth).\"  In other words, l2_delta is the change you want to see in l2 in the next feed-forward pass in the next iteration.\n",

Well, lo-and-behold, each of the 4 probability/confidence values of l2 lies somewhere on the S curve of the sigmoid graph (pictured again below, but this time with more detail).  If we search for that number (e.g. 0.9) on the Y axis of the graph below, we can see that it corresponds with a point on the S curve roughly where you see the green dot: ![alt text](https://iamtrask.github.io/img/sigmoid-deriv-2.png)\n",

        "Did you notice not only the green dot but also the green line through the dot?  That green line is meant to represent the slope of the *tangent* to the line at the exact point where that dot is.  You don't need to know calculus to take the slope of a curve at a particular point--the computer will do that for you.  But you do have to notice that the S curve above has very shallow slope at both the upper extreme (near 1) and the lower extreme (near 0).  Does that sound familiar?  Wonder of wonders, a shallow slope on the sigmoid curve coincides with high confidence and high accuracy in our predictions!  And you also need to know that a shallow slope on the S-curve comes out to a tiny number for slope.  That's good news.  Why?\n",
        "\n",
        "Because, when we go to update our synapses, we basically want to leave our high confidence weights alone since they already have good accuracy.  To \"leave them alone\" means to multiply them by tiny numbers, near zero, so the values remain virtually unchanged.  And here comes ***Big Advantage #4*** of the ***Four Big Advantages of the Sigmoid Function:*** Miracle-of-miracles, our high-confidence numbers correspond to shallow slope on the S-curve, which corresponds to tiny slope numbers.  Therefore, multiplying the values of syn0 and syn1 by these teeny-tiny numbers has exactly the effect we want: the values in our synapses are left virtually unchanged, so our confident, accurate, high-performing values in l2 remain so.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the same token, our wishy-washy, indecisive, low-accuracy l2 values, which correspond to points in the middle of the S-curve, are the numbers that have the biggest slope on our S-curve.  What I mean is, the values around 0.5 can be traced on the Y axis of our graph below to the middle of the S-curve, where the slope is steepest, and therefore the value of that slope is a big number.  Those big numbers mean a big change when we multiply them by the wishy-washy values in l2, as we do in line 61.\n",

This slope tells us which predictions were confident, and which were (wait for it...) Wishy-Washy.  This is how we find and fix the weakest links in our network, the low-confidence predictions.  We then launder our 4 slopes with `nonlin()` and multiply those 4 confidence measures by the four misses in`l2_error`and the product of this multiplication will be `l2_delta`.  Oh, Lordy!  Line 57 is an important step--did you notice that we are multiplying the Big Misses by the Wishy-Washy Predictions (i.e., the l2 predictions that had big slopes)?

Think of l2_delta as \"the change we want to see in l2 in the next iteration.\"  The **big** l2_delta values are the **big** changes we want to have in the l2 prediction of the next iteration, and we'll make those happen by making **big** tweaks in the corresponding values of syn1 and syn0 below, so in our next feed-forward pass, when we multiply l0xsyn0, the biggest values in syn0 will make a big change to our least accurate, wishy-washy-est values in l0.  So l0 will be improved.  Then, when we multiply the new-and-improved l1 by our better-weighted syn1, that will yield our best l2 prediction yet!  Happy Happy!  Joy Joy!\n",

        "When we update our synapse matrix by multiplying its corresponding element (aka, its value or number) with that large slope number, it's going to give that element a big nudge in the right direction towards confident and accurate prediction.  When I say, \"in the right direction,\" what I mean is that some values of our l2_delta are going to be negative values, because we want the product of these negative values, when multiplied by the weight values of our synapse matrix, to approach 0.  Other values of our l2_delta are going to be positive, because we want them to increase the weight values and thereby nudge the elements in syn0 and syn1 to approach 1.\n",

Of the 3 \"bowls\" pictured in the diagram above, it is clear that the true global minimum is the deepest bowl on the far left.  But, for simplicity's sake, let's pretend that the bowl in the middle is the global minimum.  So, a steep slope downwards to the right (i.e., a negative slope value, as depicted by the green line in the picture) means our ball will roll a lot in the negative direction (i.e., to the right), causing a big, negative adjustment to the corresponding weights of syn1 that will be used in the next iteration to predict l2.  But if, for example, you have a shallow slope downwards to the left, that would mean the prediction value is already accurate and confident, which produces a tiny, positive slope value, so the ball will roll very little to the left (i.e., in a positive direction), thus adjusting by very little the corresponding weight in syn1, so the next iteration's prediction of that value will remain largely unchanged.  This makes sense because the back-and-forth motion of the rolling ball is becoming smaller and smaller before it soon comes to rest at the global minimum, the bottom of the bowl, so there's no need to move much.  It is already close to the ideal.\n",

That means that, for example, every value in syn0 is a point on the X axis of our grid, and every value in syn1 is a point on the Y axis of our grid.  When we do a forward feed through out network, the value we arrive at is simply the height of our \"ball\" from the syn0, syn1 coordinate on that grid.  Once we have the height from the grid cooridinates of the plane below, we know *exactly* where our ball is on the surface of our bowl.  And when we compute gradient descent, it tells us the slope of the surface of the bowl at the exact coordinate of (syn0, syn1, and the value from Forward Feed).  Finding the slope of where our ball is tells us the direction our ball should roll to make the quickest descent to the bottom of the bowl where error is 0 because height is 0 because our ball is touching the syn0, syn1 grid plane.\n",

As you learn other networks, you will see there are many functions that \"learn\" in even more beautiful ways than the sigmoid we have studied here.\n"

        "First, let's do a quick review:\n",
        "In Step 8, we computed l2_error, which is the difference between the prediction of the network (l2) and the truth (y).  Next, in Step 10 we computed l2_delta by multiplying l2_error times the confidence levels we had in each value of l2.  And soon in Step 13 we will update syn1 by multiplying l2_delta by l1.  This multiplication is needed so that larger changes are applied to weights that have more impact on l2.  However, we do not apply this update until after we are ready to update syn0, for the sake of consistency.    \n",
        "\n",
        "This is an important distinction.  We know our goal is to get to The Ideal l2 Prediction, which is close to or the same as our truth, y.  But we'd only be using half our horsepower to get there if we only update syn1.  We want to update both syn1 and syn0 in order to maximize our efficiency in creating The Ideal I2.  Finding the l1_delta is the key to updating syn0, and that's our next job now.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Steps 11 and 12, we are going to compute the l1_delta, but in a slightly different manner.  We are going to use back propagation.    \n",
        "\n",
        "Continuing your (unmistakeable) genius, now you can work backwards to learn from your mistakes.  Your l2_delta tells you the confidence you had in each of the turns (syn1) that brought you to l2.  So, you go back through your turns and eyeball the low-confidence turns to figure out the first place you went wrong.  In math terms, you will multiply tomorrow's ideal arrival and the confidence you had in today's predictions (l2_delta) by today's not-so-perfect directions (syn1) to figure out the first place you went wrong on today's route (l1_error, which is the distance between today's screwy l1 stop and tomorrow's fabulous l1 stop).  \n",
        "\n",
        "You can then multiply the l1_error by how confident you were in your *first* set of turns/predictions that got you to l1, and the product will be the l1_delta, with which you can eagerly update syn0 to bring you ever-closer to your betrothed.  I am brushing back the tears, just thinking about it...\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider this: back when we were finding l2_error, life was easy.  We knew l2, and we knew \"The Ideal l2\" we were shooting for, which was simply y.  But with l1_error, things are different.  We don't know what \"The Ideal l1\" is.  There's no y to tell us that.  y only tells us The Ideal l2.  So, how are we going to figure out what The Ideal l1 is?  We must first figure out how much l1 would need to change to produce the desired effect on l2.  We're going to have to take what we *do* know and work backwards.  That's \"backwards\" as in, \"back propagation.\"  Now, Folks, we're goin' bigtime:\n",

        "So, here's the challenge: every time you tweak one of your 16 lines/weights/variables in syn0 and syn1, it has a ripple effect through the network.  How can you calculate the best value for each of the 16 weights while taking into consideration its ripple effect on all the other 15 weights, all at the same time?  That sounds crazy-complex, right?\n",
        "\n",
        "Can do.  Let me show you the World's Greatest Parlor Trick.  Those of you who know calculus will understand when I say we are going to use the Chain Rule to take derivatives.  But those of us who don't know calculus are not intimidated in the least because we will use slope, Good Ol' rise-over-run, to juggle 16 bowling pins in the air at the same time.  The secret?  In this context, to find the slope is to take the derivative.  They are exactly the same thing.\n",

        "Here is our overall question: \"When we nudge syn0,1 up or down, how much does that increase or decrease the l2_error?\"  In other words, think of a derivative as a \"sensitivity,\" or a relationship, or a ratio: we know that if we wiggle syn0,1, up or down, then the l2_error will wiggle up or down in proportion to that nudge.  But will it move a little?  A lot?  What is the ratio of l2_error's wiggle to syn0,1's wiggle?  How sensitive is l2_error with respect to syn0,1?\n",

        "Remember: the goal of back prop is to figure out the amount to tweak each of our 16 weights so that we can reduce our l2_error as much as possible in the next iteration.  But the challenge is that each of these 16 weights affects many of the other 15 weights, so you might say that how much you adjust Weight 1 *depends on* how much you adjust Weight 2, which *depends on* how much you adjust Weight 3, and so on.  Keep this *\"depends on\"* image in your mind because it will come in handy later in the math.  As an analogy, imagine 16 of the Minions from the *\"Despicable Me\"* movie, and these 16 minions are aligned in perfect formation and cooperating perfectly as one body in order to serve their master, Felonius Gru.\n",

In fact, how much a given ratio \"B\" is changed by the change of the preceding ratio \"A\" depends on *where* the coordinates of Ratio B fall on the graph of Function B on the grid.  So calculating change is not possible if a ratio is fixed.  It *is* possible if a function is linear or non-linear, but in order to calculate change you must calculate the slope of the ratio.  Why?  Because how much a ratio changes depends on where it falls on the grid in the graph of the function.  Once you know the slope of a function you know how much it varies given its location.  And to calculate slope, you need at least 2 sets of coordinates.  \n",

In other words, we're not just comparing how a single number 2 in syn0,1 affects a single number 0.3 in l2_error.  We want to compare how a *change* in the number 2 in syn0,1 will in turn change the 5 rippling ratios to ultimately create a better, future l2_error.  Specifically, we want to make that 0.3 value smaller, as quickly as possible.

We know x_current is L1, or 0.98 (If you eyeball the S-curve, you'll notice that 0.98 is the Y coordinate of 5, which was our l1_LH product.  Cool, huh?).   y_current is L2_LH, the product of l1 x syn1,1 *plus* the products of the other neurons multiplied by their synapses (which we conveniently made up as -2) = 0.94.  Note that, on this ratio, the code does not ask us to take the derivative (aka slope).  So for our x_nearby and our y_nearby, we can choose any darn number we please.  Let's keep it simple and choose 1's all around.  Subtract, divide, done.  Hallelujah.\n",

Note that the code in line 71 on this one is asking us to take slope, so you know we'll be eyeballing our S-curve again.  x_current is l1_LH, or 5, so look that up on our X axis.  y_current lines up at about 0.98, no?  Done.  Now, since we're taking slope this time, for our x-and-y nearby's we have to find a nice pair of coodinates on our S-curve that make for convenient math.  How 'bout x_nearby as 6?  That would make y_nearby as about 0.99.  Lovely.  Do the math and it's 0.01.  Joy.\n",

        "Final Ratio, #5, Ripple 1, the gust of wind in Nevada.  The source of our mountain stream.  x_current is syn0,1, or 2.  y_current is l1_LH, or 5.  Line 76 of our code is not asking for any slopes/derivatives because it is a linear function (which looks like a straight line on a graph), so the distance between coordinates can be very large and the slope will still be exactly right.  For curvy functions (parabolas, sigmoids, etc) the points should be close together to minimize the effect of curvature on your estimate of the slope.  Thus, for our nearby's on this linear function, we can use numbers that are, well...convenient, rather than nearby.  Hence: x_nearby is 1 and y_nearby is 4 and the math happens to work out (again, conveniently) to 1, which is the l0 mentioned in line 76.  \n",

        "We take the slope of l2 to fix the most mistaken of our 16 weights faster.  How?  Well, you may recall from our discussion of the Sigmoid function (and the S-curve diagram) above that the slope of l2 is the confidence level of l2.  The smallest slope numbers indicate the highest confidence level.  Therefore, multiplying the corresponding values of the l2_error by these small numbers ain't gonna cause a big change in the l2_delta product, which is good.  We don't want to change those weights much, because we're already pretty confident in the job they're doing.  \n",
        "\n",
        "But the l2 prediction numbers that we are *least* confident in have the steepest slope, which yields a larger number.  When we mutliply that larger number by the l2_error then the resulting l2_delta has a bigger number.  When we update syn1 later on, that bigger multiplier is going to mean a bigger product, and therefore a bigger change, or tweak, in that value.  This is as it should be, because we want to take the weights we have the least confidence in and change them the most.  That's where we will get the biggest \"bang for our buck\" when it comes to tweaking the 16 weights of our system.  To summarize, taking the slope of l2 gives us the confidence of each l2 prediction, which allows us to home in on the numbers that most need fixing, and fix them the fastest.\n",
